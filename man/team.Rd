\description{
Typically you will not have to use this function explicitly, but it can
be used to build on top of the {fantasy} package.
}
\details{
This function takes in 15 player IDs and a captain/vice-captain designation,
enriches this into a tibble with information on each player, then validates
this against a set of criteria to ensure the selected 15 is valid. It then
returns the enriched tibble as an object of class team.
