One of the ways to use {fantasy} is for extracting data from the FPL API for further analysis. This might be in order to analyse good players to sign, track your progress over the season, or even build a machine learning model to make team decisions for you. There are a few different types of data that can be extracted.

## Fixtures

## Teams

## Players

## Leagues

## Managers/Users

## Predicted lineups (alternative source)
